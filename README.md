# SecretVault

## Description

SecretVault is a secure and efficient secret management library written in Rust. It provides a robust mechanism for storing, retrieving, and managing sensitive data such as API keys, passwords, and configuration settings. The library is designed with security and ease of use in mind, offering features like encryption, access control, and versioning. SecretVault aims to simplify the process of handling secrets in applications, reducing the risk of exposure and improving overall security posture.

## Features

*   **Encryption:** Secrets are encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) both at rest and in transit, ensuring confidentiality.
*   **Access Control:** Granular access control mechanisms allow you to define which users or services can access specific secrets, minimizing the attack surface.
*   **Versioning:** SecretVault maintains a history of secret changes, allowing you to revert to previous versions if necessary and track modifications over time.
*   **Secure Storage:** Secrets are stored in a secure backend, such as a dedicated key management system (KMS) or encrypted file, preventing unauthorized access.
*   **Rotation:** Provides functionality for automated secret rotation, reducing the risk associated with long-lived credentials.

## Installation

To install SecretVault, you will need Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You can download Rust from the official website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once Rust is installed, follow these steps:

1.  **Add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file:**

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    secretvault = "0.1.0" # Replace with the latest version
    ```

2.  **Build your project:**

    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

3.  **Ensure you have a suitable storage backend configured.** SecretVault is designed to be backend agnostic. You will need to implement or integrate with your chosen backend (e.g., KMS, encrypted file, database).  Example implementations are planned but not included in the core library. You will need to create the backend implementation.

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use SecretVault in your Rust code.  These examples assume you have created a `Vault` struct and a basic `Secret` struct, and implemented the `SecretVaultBackend` trait.

```rust
use secretvault::{Vault, Secret, SecretVaultBackend};

// Assume a basic implementation of a SecretVaultBackend trait
struct MockBackend;

impl SecretVaultBackend for MockBackend {
    fn get_secret(&self, secret_name: &str) -> Result<Option<Secret>, String> {
        // Placeholder implementation - Replace with actual backend logic
        if secret_name == "my_api_key" {
            Ok(Some(Secret {
                name: secret_name.to_string(),
                value: "super_secret_api_key".to_string(),
                version: 1,
            }))
        } else {
            Ok(None)
        }
    }

    fn put_secret(&mut self, secret: Secret) -> Result<(), String> {
        // Placeholder implementation - Replace with actual backend logic
        println!("Storing secret: {} with value: {}", secret.name, secret.value);
        Ok(())
    }

    fn delete_secret(&mut self, secret_name: &str) -> Result<(), String> {
        // Placeholder implementation - Replace with actual backend logic
        println!("Deleting secret: {}", secret_name);
        Ok(())
    }
}

fn main() -> Result<(), String> {
    // Initialize the Vault with a backend
    let backend = MockBackend;
    let mut vault = Vault::new(backend);

    // Get a secret
    match vault.get_secret("my_api_key") {
        Ok(Some(secret)) => {
            println!("Secret name: {}", secret.name);
            println!("Secret value: {}", secret.value);
            println!("Secret version: {}", secret.version);
        }
        Ok(None) => println!("Secret not found"),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }

    // Put a secret
    let new_secret = Secret {
        name: "database_password".to_string(),
        value: "secure_password123".to_string(),
        version: 1,
    };

    if let Err(e) = vault.put_secret(new_secret) {
        println!("Error storing secret: {}", e);
    }

    // Delete a secret
    if let Err(e) = vault.delete_secret("my_api_key") {
        println!("Error deleting secret: {}", e);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   The `MockBackend` struct is a placeholder implementation of the `SecretVaultBackend` trait. You would replace this with your actual backend implementation.
*   The `get_secret` function retrieves a secret by name.  The example returns a hardcoded secret for "my\_api\_key".
*   The `put_secret` function stores a secret.
*   The `delete_secret` function deletes a secret.
*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `Vault` to get, put, and delete secrets.

**Note:** This example provides a basic illustration of how to use SecretVault. You will need to adapt the code to your specific requirements and backend implementation. The provided `MockBackend` is not secure and should only be used for testing purposes.
