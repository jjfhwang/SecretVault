# SecretVault

## Description

SecretVault is a Rust-based repository focused on providing robust and efficient implementations of decentralized ledger consensus algorithms and cryptographic primitives. This project aims to offer developers a reliable and auditable foundation for building secure and decentralized applications. It provides well-tested and documented implementations, enabling developers to integrate advanced cryptographic and consensus mechanisms into their projects with confidence. The goal is to foster innovation in the decentralized space by providing high-quality, reusable components.

## Features

*   **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) Consensus:** Implementation of a practical BFT consensus algorithm suitable for permissioned blockchain networks, ensuring resilience against malicious actors.
*   **Threshold Cryptography:** Support for threshold signatures and encryption schemes, allowing secret sharing and distributed key management for enhanced security.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Integration of ZKP libraries for enabling privacy-preserving transactions and data verification without revealing sensitive information.
*   **Hashing Algorithms:** Secure and optimized implementations of various cryptographic hash functions, including SHA-256, SHA-3, and BLAKE2b, for data integrity and authentication.
*   **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC):** Comprehensive ECC support, including key generation, digital signatures (ECDSA, EdDSA), and key exchange (Diffie-Hellman) using established curves like secp256k1 and Curve25519.

## Installation

To install SecretVault and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Rust and Cargo:** If you don't have Rust installed, download and install it from the official Rust website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). This will also install Cargo, the Rust package manager.

2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the SecretVault repository from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/SecretVault.git
    cd SecretVault
    ```

3.  **Build the Project:** Build the project using Cargo:

    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

4.  **Run Tests:** Ensure that all tests pass by running:

    ```bash
    cargo test
    ```

5.  **Install Dependencies:** SecretVault may depend on specific system libraries. Ensure you have the following installed, depending on your operating system:

    *   **Linux:** You might need to install `libssl-dev` or `openssl-devel`.
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
        ```
    *   **macOS:** OpenSSL is typically included, but you might need to install it using Homebrew if it's not available:
        ```bash
        brew install openssl
        ```
        You may also need to set environment variables for `cargo` to find the OpenSSL installation.
        ```bash
        export OPENSSL_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1
        export OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=$OPENSSL_DIR/include
        export OPENSSL_LIB_DIR=$OPENSSL_DIR/lib
        ```

    *   **Windows:** You may need to install OpenSSL and ensure that the necessary DLLs are in your system's PATH. Consider using a package manager like Chocolatey:
        ```bash
        choco install openssl
        ```
        And set the environment variables similarly to macOS, adjusting paths as needed.

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use SecretVault's cryptographic primitives:

```rust
// src/lib.rs

pub mod crypto {
    pub mod hashing {
        use sha2::{Sha256, Digest};

        pub fn sha256_hash(data: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
            let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
            hasher.update(data);
            hasher.finalize().to_vec()
        }
    }

    pub mod ecc {
        use k256::{ecdsa::{SigningKey, signature::Signer, VerifyingKey, Signature, signature::Verifier}, elliptic_curve::rand_core::OsRng};

        pub fn generate_keypair() -> (SigningKey, VerifyingKey) {
            let signing_key = SigningKey::random(&mut OsRng);
            let verifying_key = signing_key.verifying_key();
            (signing_key, verifying_key)
        }

        pub fn sign_message(signing_key: &SigningKey, message: &[u8]) -> Signature {
            let signature: Signature = signing_key.sign(message);
            signature
        }

        pub fn verify_signature(verifying_key: &VerifyingKey, message: &[u8], signature: &Signature) -> bool {
            verifying_key.verify(message, signature).is_ok()
        }
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_sha256_hashing() {
        let data = b"Hello, SecretVault!";
        let hash = crypto::hashing::sha256_hash(data);
        assert_eq!(hash.len(), 32); // SHA-256 produces a 32-byte hash
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_ecdsa_signing_and_verification() {
        let (signing_key, verifying_key) = crypto::ecc::generate_keypair();
        let message = b"Sign this message!";
        let signature = crypto::ecc::sign_message(&signing_key, message);
        let is_valid = crypto::ecc::verify_signature(&verifying_key, message, &signature);
        assert!(is_valid);
    }
}

```

```rust
// main.rs

use SecretVault::crypto::hashing;

fn main() {
    let data = b"This is the data to hash.";
    let hash = hashing::sha256_hash(data);
    println!("SHA-256 Hash: {:?}", hash);
}

```

To run the example:

1.  Add the example code to `src/lib.rs` and `src/main.rs` as shown above.
2.  Build the project: `cargo build`
3.  Run the project: `cargo run`
